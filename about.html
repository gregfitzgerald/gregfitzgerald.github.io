        <h1>About</h1>

        <!-- [CONTENT-NEEDED: Professional headshot photo] -->

        <p>I'm a neuroscience researcher with 15 years of experience spanning lab management, experimental research, and quantitative analysis. I currently work in the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/psychology/faculty/ewan-mcnay" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behavioral Neuroscience Lab</a> at the University at Albany, where my doctoral research uses meta-analysis to evaluate Alzheimer's disease interventions — work that uncovered a 2.5× gap between how well treatments work in rodents versus humans.</p>

        <p>Before Albany, I managed a laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where I gained hands-on experience running research operations, managing animal colonies, and coordinating with multiple research teams. That operational experience informs how I approach research today: systematically, with attention to both the science and the logistics that make good science possible.</p>

        <h2 class="nocount">What I Do</h2>

        <p>My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience and research methodology. I use quantitative tools — meta-analysis, systematic review, statistical modeling — to synthesize large bodies of preclinical research and identify patterns that individual studies can't reveal. My key finding so far: rodent models of AD consistently overestimate treatment effects by approximately 2.5×, which has direct implications for how the pharmaceutical industry evaluates drug candidates in their pipeline.</p>

        <p>I've published in <em>Cell</em> (Impact Factor 64.5), managed a 500+ mouse breeding colony, taught statistics and research methods for 7 semesters, and built web applications as portfolio projects. I bring a rare combination of deep scientific expertise and practical technical skills.</p>

        <h2 class="nocount">Research Interests</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neurotrophic factors and aging:</strong> How growth factors like IGF-2 influence brain health and cognitive function across the lifespan</li>
            <li><strong>Meta-analysis methodology:</strong> Systematic review techniques for synthesizing neuroscience and psychology research</li>
            <li><strong>Translational research:</strong> Bridging the gap between preclinical findings and clinical outcomes in Alzheimer's disease</li>
            <li><strong>Research reproducibility:</strong> Improving statistical practices, study design, and transparency in behavioral research</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="nocount">What I'm Looking For</h2>

        <p>I'm seeking entry-level positions in biotech, pharmaceutical research, or data science — roles where I can apply my analytical skills and domain expertise to industry problems. I'm particularly interested in positions involving evidence synthesis, data analysis, research methodology, or translational science in the Albany/Capital District area or remote.</p>

        <h2 class="nocount">Outside the Lab</h2>

        <p>When I'm not analyzing data or writing, I enjoy hiking in the Catskills and Adirondacks, reading about science and philosophy, building small web projects, and spending time with my turtle, <a href="jimmy.html">Jimmy</a>.</p>
