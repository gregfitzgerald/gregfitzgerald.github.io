# Content Quality & Messaging Audit

**Auditor:** Professional Copywriting & Personal Branding Review  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Subject:** greg-fitzgerald.com  
**Context:** Greg Fitzgerald is a neuroscience PhD researcher (ABD) at University at Albany, actively searching for entry-level industry positions in biotech, pharma, and data science.

---

## Executive Summary

This site has solid bones — clean design, clear navigation, real research substance — but it's currently optimized for the wrong audience. Every page reads like it was written by a graduate student talking to other academics. That's a problem when the primary goal is landing an industry job.

The site needs to shift from *"Here's my academic life"* to *"Here's what I can do for your company."* That doesn't mean abandoning the academic content — it means reframing it through an industry lens.

**The three biggest problems, in order:**

1. **Identity crisis:** The site says "graduate student" everywhere but Greg is finishing a PhD and needs to present as a professional ready for industry. This is the single most damaging messaging issue.
2. **No audience strategy:** There's no content aimed at recruiters, hiring managers, or potential employers. The site assumes every visitor is an academic peer.
3. **Placeholder overload:** CV page is empty brackets, 4 of 5 blog posts are stubs, gallery is templates, Calendly is missing, academic profiles are fake URLs. A site with this many visible placeholders actively hurts credibility.

**The good news:** The IGF-2 paper is genuinely impressive. The meta-analysis project demonstrates real quantitative chops. The Exerkine concept shows entrepreneurial thinking. The raw material here is strong — it just needs to be packaged and positioned correctly.

## 1. Homepage Messaging

### Current State

The opening paragraph:

> *"I'm a behavioral neuroscientist and graduate student researching meta-analysis methodology and neurotrophic factors in Alzheimer's disease."*

### Problems

- **"Graduate student" is the second thing a visitor reads.** For a recruiter scanning this page, they've already mentally categorized Greg as "not ready" before finishing the sentence.
- **The intro is a description, not a value proposition.** It tells you what Greg *is*, not what Greg *does* or what problems he *solves*.
- **Too much jargon upfront.** "Meta-analysis methodology and neurotrophic factors" means nothing to a biotech HR person or a data science hiring manager. It's insider language.
- **No hook.** There's nothing compelling, surprising, or memorable in the first 50 words. A visitor decides whether to stay or bounce in 5-7 seconds.
- **The three-column layout with placeholder widgets looks broken.** The Twitter widget shows fake tweets. The Goodreads widget shows a fake book. The Calendly widget shows "Available times shown here." This communicates "this site isn't finished" louder than any content.

### Recommended Rewrite

The homepage intro should follow this structure:

1. **One sentence: Who you are + what you bring to the table** (not your job title — your capability)
2. **One sentence: Your specific expertise and what makes it valuable**
3. **One sentence: What you're looking for** (so recruiters know immediately)

Example direction:

> *"I turn messy preclinical research into clear, quantitative answers. My doctoral work at the University at Albany uses meta-analysis and statistical modeling to evaluate Alzheimer's disease interventions — work that revealed a 2.5x gap between rodent and human effect sizes, with direct implications for how pharma companies evaluate drug candidates. I'm completing my PhD and seeking roles in biotech, pharma, or data science where I can apply these analytical skills to real-world problems."*

This version:
- Leads with capability, not title
- Mentions the 2.5x finding (specific, memorable, shows impact)
- Names the industries he's targeting
- Signals he's available without sounding desperate

### Other Homepage Issues

- **"Recent Writing" section** only shows one post from January 2025. This looks stale. Either add more posts or relabel it "Featured Writing."
- **"Featured Projects" cards** are fine structurally but need punchier descriptions that emphasize outcomes and skills used, not just topics.
- **Remove or populate the sidebar widgets.** Placeholder widgets are worse than no widgets. If you don't have a Calendly, Twitter, or Goodreads account set up, remove these entirely and use a single-column layout. You can add them back when they're real.

---

## 2. About Page

### Current State

The about page reads like a CV narrative — competent but impersonal. It follows a safe academic template: research interests, background, philosophy, personal interests.

### Problems

- **No story.** There's no narrative arc. Why did Greg get into neuroscience? What drives him? What moment made him care about research methodology? Stories are memorable; bullet lists aren't.
- **No differentiation.** This about page could belong to any neuroscience grad student. What makes Greg *Greg*? The Cell publication (Impact Factor 64.5) isn't mentioned. The 15 years of research experience isn't mentioned. The Cold Spring Harbor Lab management role isn't mentioned. The startup concept isn't mentioned.
- **"Graduate student" framing again.** The first sentence: *"I'm a graduate student in the Behavioral Neuroscience Lab..."* — this needs to change.
- **The "Philosophy" section is generic.** "I believe that science progresses through careful, methodical work combined with clear communication" — this could be anyone. Cut it or make it specific.
- **"Outside Research" is too brief.** "Hiking, reading about science and philosophy, and spending time with my turtle Jimmy" is fine, but it's one sentence. This is where personality lives. A slightly longer, warmer paragraph here would make the whole page feel more human.

### Recommended Structure

1. **Opening hook** — A specific moment, question, or realization that captures Greg's intellectual journey. Not a CV summary.
2. **Professional narrative** — Told as a story with a clear thread. Something like: CSHL lab management → Cell publication → growing interest in methodology → PhD focused on meta-analysis → discovering the translation gap → ready for industry. This shows *progression*, not just a list.
3. **What I bring** — 2-3 paragraphs on specific, differentiating strengths (quantitative skills, cross-domain experience, teaching ability, translational perspective).
4. **The human stuff** — Jimmy, interests, personality. Make it warm. This is the part that makes someone want to work with you, not just hire your skills.

### Missing Content That Would Help

- **Professional photo/headshot.** The about page has no image. A face makes a page 100x more personal.
- **Specific numbers.** 15 years research, 500+ mouse colony management, 7 semesters teaching, Cell IF 64.5, 50+ page curriculum. Numbers are concrete and credible.
- **A "What I'm looking for" statement.** Something like: *"I'm seeking entry-level positions in biotech, pharmaceutical research, or data science in the Albany/Capital District area where I can apply my analytical skills to industry challenges."* Recruiters need to know this immediately.

## 3. Professional Positioning

This is the most critical issue across the entire site.

### The Problem

The word "student" or "graduate student" appears in:
- The homepage `<title>` tag and meta description
- The homepage opening paragraph
- The about page opening paragraph
- The OG meta tags (what shows up when shared on LinkedIn/Twitter)

Greg is not a "student" in the way most people understand that word. He's a researcher with 15 years of experience who is completing a doctoral program. The framing should reflect his expertise, not his enrollment status.

### What to Do

**Everywhere on the site, replace "graduate student" with language like:**
- "Neuroscience researcher" 
- "Behavioral neuroscientist"
- "PhD researcher"
- "Doctoral researcher specializing in..."

**In the meta description (what Google shows):**

Current: *"Graduate student researching meta-analysis methodology and neurotrophic factors in Alzheimer's disease."*

Better: *"Neuroscience researcher specializing in meta-analysis, statistical methodology, and Alzheimer's disease therapeutics. PhD candidate at the University at Albany."*

**The positioning should emphasize:**
- Industry-relevant skills (data analysis, statistical modeling, R/Python, systematic review)
- Translational research perspective (bridging preclinical and clinical)
- Quantitative rigor (meta-analysis, effect sizes, power analysis)
- Cross-functional experience (research, lab management, teaching, writing)

### Add a "Skills & Expertise" Section

This could live on the about page or as a standalone page. For industry-targeting, Greg needs a clear, scannable list of:

**Technical Skills:**
- R (metafor, tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Python (data analysis)
- SPSS
- Meta-analysis (systematic review, effect size calculation, heterogeneity analysis, publication bias assessment)
- Statistical modeling
- Data visualization
- Scientific writing

**Domain Knowledge:**
- Alzheimer's disease / neurodegeneration
- Neurotrophic factors (IGF-2, BDNF)
- Preclinical-to-clinical translation
- Behavioral neuroscience
- Research methodology / reproducibility

**Soft Skills:**
- Teaching / training (7 semesters)
- Lab management (500+ animal colony, budgets, purchasing)
- Scientific communication
- Curriculum development
- Mentoring

## 4. Call-to-Action Clarity

### Page-by-Page Assessment

| Page | Current CTA | Problem | Recommended CTA |
|------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Homepage** | "Learn more →" links to projects; "book a session" link to tutoring | Too many directions, no primary CTA for the main audience (recruiters) | Add prominent "Get in touch" or "View my CV" button. Make it obvious what a recruiter should do. |
| **About** | "← back to home" | Dead end. After reading about Greg, what should I do? | Add: "Interested in working together? Get in touch" + link to contact page. Or: "Download my CV" |
| **Research** | "← back to home" | Same dead end | Add: "Have a research question? Let's talk" + link to contact |
| **Projects** | Individual project links (some broken placeholders) | No unifying CTA | Add: "Want to see more of my work? Check out my GitHub" or "Interested in collaborating?" |
| **Tutoring** | "Contact me directly" (since Calendly isn't set up) | Acceptable but weak | Set up Calendly. Or at minimum, add Greg's email directly on the page with a clear "Email me to book: [email]" |
| **Contact** | Email addresses listed | Adequate but passive | Add a brief contact form or at least a bolded "Best way to reach me: [email]" |
| **Writing** | None | Posts are listed but there's no CTA | Add: "Subscribe via RSS" or "Follow me for updates" |
| **CV** | None (page is all placeholders) | This page is the most critical for job seekers and it's completely empty | **FILL THIS IN IMMEDIATELY.** This is priority #1. |

### The CV Page Is an Emergency

A recruiter who finds this site and clicks "CV" will see:

> `[Degree Name]`  
> `[Year - Year]`  
> `[Institution Name]`  
> `[Brief description or thesis title]`

This is catastrophic for credibility. If the CV page can't be filled in today, **remove it from the navigation entirely.** A missing page is better than a page that screams "this person couldn't be bothered to fill in their own resume."

## 5. Writing Quality Assessment

### Tone

The current writing across the site is:
- **Competent but flat.** Grammatically clean, well-organized, but reads like a methods section rather than a personal website.
- **Too passive.** Heavy use of passive constructions: "I'm involved in," "I'm committed to," "I'm interested in." These are weak verbs. Replace with active ones: "I lead," "I built," "I discovered."
- **Overly hedged.** Academic training teaches hedging ("may," "could potentially," "shows promise"). For a personal site targeting industry, be more direct: "This works." "This matters." "I can do this."

### Specific Examples

**Weak:** *"I'm passionate about improving scientific research through better methodology, reproducible practices, and effective communication."*

**Stronger:** *"Bad methodology wastes millions of dollars and years of researchers' lives. I fix that. My work on meta-analysis has identified a 2.5x inflation in preclinical effect sizes — the kind of finding that changes how companies evaluate drug candidates."*

**Weak:** *"My approach focuses on building deep conceptual understanding rather than memorizing formulas."*

**Stronger:** *"Most stats tutoring teaches you to plug numbers into formulas. I teach you to think like a scientist. That's why my students don't just pass their exams — they actually understand what their data is telling them."*

### Recommendations

- **Use first person actively.** "I built," "I discovered," "I teach." Not "It was found that" or "Research was conducted."
- **Lead with impact, not process.** Don't say "I conducted a meta-analysis." Say "My meta-analysis revealed that rodent studies overestimate drug effectiveness by 2.5x — a finding with direct implications for pharma R&D."
- **Write shorter paragraphs.** Many current paragraphs are 3-4 sentences of dense academic prose. Break them up. White space is your friend on the web.
- **Add specific numbers wherever possible.** "Years of teaching" → "7 semesters." "Large animal colony" → "500+ mouse breeding colony." "Prestigious publication" → "Cell (Impact Factor 64.5)."

## 6. Missing Content

### Must-Have (Critical for Job Search)

1. **"What I'm Looking For" section (homepage or about page)**
   - Title: "Open to Opportunities" or "Seeking Industry Roles"
   - Content: Target roles (research scientist, data analyst, etc.), target industries (biotech, pharma, CROs), location preferences, what Greg brings to the table
   - Why: Recruiters need to know immediately if Greg is a fit. Don't make them guess.

2. **Filled-in CV page**
   - This is non-negotiable. The current empty-bracket version is actively harmful.
   - Include a downloadable PDF version.
   - Highlight the Cell publication prominently.

3. **Skills section with industry framing**
   - Technical skills (R, Python, SPSS, meta-analysis tools)
   - Domain expertise (AD, neurotrophic factors, translational research)
   - Transferable skills (data visualization, scientific writing, lab management, teaching)

4. **LinkedIn link**
   - Not visible anywhere on the site. If Greg has a LinkedIn profile, it should be in the contact page and probably the footer of every page.

5. **Professional headshot**
   - No photo anywhere on the site. For a personal branding site, this is a significant gap.

### Should-Have (Strengthens the Site)

6. **Project impact stories**
   - For each project, answer: "What was the problem? What did I do? What was the result? Why does it matter?" This is the STAR format that industry understands.

7. **A "How I Work" section**
   - Describe your approach to analysis, your tools, your workflow. This is what hiring managers want to see.

8. **Testimonials from colleagues or supervisors** (not just tutoring students)
   - A quote from Greg's PI, a collaborator, or a former supervisor would add enormous credibility.

### Nice-to-Have (Polish)

9. **Filled-in Jimmy page** — This is charming and humanizing. People remember the turtle guy.
10. **Gallery with actual images** — Currently all placeholders. Either fill it or remove it.
11. **Real social media profiles** — The placeholder Twitter/Goodreads/ORCID links need to either be real or removed.

## 7. Blog Strategy

### Current State

One published post (the IGF-2 review, January 2025) and four empty stubs. The writing page feels abandoned.

### Priority Order for Blog Posts

Ranked by how much each post would help the job search:

1. **Meta-Analysis Methodology post** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - This is the post that directly demonstrates Greg's most marketable skill
   - The 2.5x finding is a compelling hook that industry people will understand
   - Target audience: pharma, biotech, CROs — the exact companies Greg wants to work for
   - Frame it as: "What Pharma Gets Wrong About Preclinical Evidence (And How Meta-Analysis Fixes It)"
   - This post alone could generate inbound interest from employers

2. **Claude Code for Researchers**
   - Demonstrates AI tool proficiency — a hot differentiator right now
   - Shows Greg can bridge technical tools and research workflows
   - Could attract organic search traffic (people searching for Claude Code tutorials)
   - Frame it as: "How I Use AI to Accelerate My Research (Without Letting It Do the Thinking)"

3. **AI-Resistant Learning Platform**
   - Shows software/product thinking, which is valuable for industry roles
   - Demonstrates understanding of AI's impact on education
   - Good for edtech or data science conversations

4. **Scientific Research Literacy Overview**
   - Demonstrates teaching and curriculum development skills
   - Less directly useful for the job search but good content
   - Could be the basis for a workshop or training offering

### Blog Post Formats That Would Help

Beyond the existing stubs, consider these types:

- **"What I Learned From..." posts** — Short, personal, insightful. "What I Learned From Managing a 500-Mouse Colony" is more interesting to a hiring manager than a methods paper.
- **Data visualization showcases** — Take a finding from the dissertation and create a beautiful visualization with commentary. Shows R/Python skills visually.
- **"Translating Research for Non-Scientists" series** — Take complex neuroscience concepts and explain them accessibly. Demonstrates communication skills.
- **Industry-bridge posts** — "What Pharma Should Know About Publication Bias" or "How to Read a Preclinical Meta-Analysis (A Guide for Non-Statisticians)"

### Posting Cadence

Don't try to write everything. Two substantial, well-written posts are worth more than five mediocre ones. Aim for:
- 1 long-form post per month
- Focus on quality, specificity, and voice
- Each post should be shareable on LinkedIn

---

## 8. Tutoring Page

### Current State

The page is functional but reads like a course catalog description. It lists topics covered and pricing, which is necessary but not sufficient.

### Problems

1. **No social proof.** The testimonials section loads from a JSON file that contains placeholder data. This means either (a) the testimonials don't load at all, or (b) fake testimonials appear. Either way, it's a problem.

2. **No "why me" statement.** Why should someone choose Greg over other tutors? What's different about his approach? The page says "deep conceptual understanding rather than memorizing formulas" — this is good but needs to be expanded with examples.

3. **No results or outcomes.** "My students go from struggling with p-values to confidently designing their own studies." "I've helped X students pass their stats comprehensive exams." Numbers and outcomes build trust.

4. **Pricing without context.** $50/hr undergrad, $75/hr grad is listed but with no framing. Is this competitive? What's included? How long is a typical engagement? First session free? Package deals?

5. **Booking is broken.** The Calendly placeholder means there's no way to actually book. The fallback "contact me directly" is weak — every click of friction loses potential clients.

### Recommendations

- **Add a "Who This Is For" section.** "Ideal for students who: are struggling with stats courses, need help with thesis methodology, want to learn R for data analysis, are preparing for comprehensive exams."
- **Add real testimonials or remove the section.** Fake reviews are worse than no reviews.
- **Simplify booking.** If Calendly isn't happening soon, put a clear email link with subject line pre-filled: `mailto:greg.s.fitzgerald@gmail.com?subject=Tutoring%20Inquiry`
- **Add a brief FAQ.** "How does it work? What should I prepare? Do you help with specific homework problems?"
- **Frame as consulting, not just tutoring.** "Research Methods Consulting" sounds more professional than "tutoring" and opens the door to professional clients, not just students.

## 9. Page-Specific Quick Fixes

### Contact Page
- Remove all placeholder URLs (ORCID, Google Scholar, ResearchGate with fake URLs). They hurt credibility.
- Add LinkedIn if it exists.
- Move email addresses to the top — that's what 90% of visitors are looking for.
- The "Manuscript Review" section is oddly specific for someone job searching. Consider replacing with "Let's Connect" language that's open to industry conversations.

### Research Page
- Good content but needs industry translation. After each research description, add a "Why it matters" line that a non-academic would understand.
- Conference presentations section — verify these are accurate and complete.
- The "Collaborations" section mentioning Columbia University is a strong signal. Keep it.

### Projects Page
- The Exerkine Performance startup concept is the most interesting thing on this page for industry audiences. Move it higher.
- GitHub placeholder URLs need fixing or removal.
- The Lab Inventory Management Tool shows practical software development skills — add more technical detail (what language? What frameworks? Is it deployed?).

### Writing Page
- Currently shows only one post from January 2025. This looks abandoned.
- Don't list stub/draft posts here. Only show published content.
- Consider renaming to "Writing & Research" to be broader.

### Gallery Page
- 100% placeholders. Remove from navigation until real content exists.

### Jimmy Page
- Empty stub. Either fill it in (it only takes 10 minutes and adds personality) or remove the link from the about page.

16. Collect and add real testimonials.
17. Set up real academic profiles (ORCID, Google Scholar).
18. Fill in gallery with actual content.
19. Consider adding a "Portfolio" or "Case Studies" framing for projects.

---

## Final Thought

Greg has genuinely impressive credentials hiding behind modest academic language. A Cell publication. 15 years of research. A quantitative finding (2.5x effect size gap) that's directly relevant to how pharma evaluates drug candidates. A 50-page curriculum he wrote. A startup concept. Lab management experience.

The site currently buries all of this under hedging language and placeholder content. The fix isn't about making the site flashier — it's about letting Greg's actual accomplishments speak for themselves, clearly, to the people who need to hear them.

Stop presenting as a student. Start presenting as a scientist who's ready to solve industry problems.
