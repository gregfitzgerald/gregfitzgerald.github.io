            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>15+ years of research experience spanning whole-brain imaging, preclinical neuroscience, and quantitative evidence synthesis. My work bridges wet-lab techniques and data-driven analysis, with a consistent focus on translational validity — asking whether what we find in the lab holds up in the real world.</p>

            <h3 class="nocount">Meta-Analysis of Environmental Enrichment &amp; Cognition</h3>
            <p><strong>SUNY Albany · Adviser: James Stellar, Ph.D. · 2023–present</strong></p>
            <p>My doctoral thesis uses meta-analytic methods to investigate whether standard laboratory housing conditions systematically bias cognitive research findings. By comparing environmental enrichment effect sizes in rodents with analogous enrichment interventions in humans, the analysis revealed that rodents show approximately <strong>2.5× larger cognitive enhancement</strong> — suggesting that under-resourced housing inflates preclinical effect sizes.</p>
            <p>This has direct implications for the pharmaceutical industry: neural drugs acting on the same cognitive pathways as enrichment interventions may be systematically overestimated in preclinical trials, contributing to translational failure.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Multi-database systematic search, effect size modeling, heterogeneity analysis, publication bias assessment, cross-species comparison (R, metafor package).</p>
            <p><em>Publication in preparation.</em></p>

            <h2 class="nocount">Past Research</h2>

            <h3 class="nocount">IGF-2 and Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
            <p><strong>SUNY Albany · McNay Lab · 2016–2023</strong></p>
            <p>Investigated early neurophysiological changes in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Tested whether intranasal administration of the neurotrophic peptide IGF-2 could prevent expected cognitive decline. Performed 6 weeks of daily intranasal administration protocols and assessed cognition using inhibitory avoidance, contextual fear conditioning, and spontaneous alternation paradigms across ~200 rats.</p>
            <p>Also authored a <strong>first-author review paper</strong> comprehensively synthesizing the evidence for IGF-2 as a therapeutic and preventive agent for Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <h3 class="nocount">Brain-wide GABAergic Interneuron Mapping &amp; CNTNAP2 Autism Model</h3>
            <p><strong>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory · Osten Lab · 2011–2016</strong></p>
            <p>Used <strong>serial two-photon tomography</strong> — a whole-brain imaging technique with single-cell resolution — to characterize the distribution of three types of GABAergic interneurons (PV, SST, VIP) across the entire mouse brain, both within regions and across development. The work revealed stereotyped cell-type-based cortical architecture and subcortical sexual dimorphism, and was published in <em>Cell</em> (IF 64.5).</p>
            <p>In parallel, investigated the link between specific mutations, neural circuits, and social behaviors in the CNTNAP2 knockout mouse model of autism. Performed stereotaxic viral injections to selectively drive or suppress putative social brain circuits, and used c-fos mapping to compare brain activation patterns between wild-type and CNTNAP2 KO mice. Assessed the effectiveness of various drugs in enhancing sociability.</p>

            <h3 class="nocount">Reward-Based Learning &amp; Conditioned Flavor Preference</h3>
            <p><strong>CUNY Graduate Center · Bodnar Lab · 2009–2011</strong></p>
            <p>Investigated the role of dopamine and opioid neurotransmitter systems in reward-based learning using conditioned flavor preference paradigms in BALB/c and SWR mouse strains. Performed c-fos immunohistochemistry to map brain activation patterns in reward circuitry (prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, VTA). Contributed to studies examining the effects of systemic dopamine and opioid antagonism.</p>
