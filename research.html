            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>My research focuses on understanding the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive function and aging, with particular emphasis on neurotrophic factors and their therapeutic potential. I'm also actively involved in meta-analytic research to synthesize findings across studies and improve research methodology.</p>

            <h2 class="nocount">Current Projects</h2>

            <h3 class="nocount">IGF2 and Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
            <p>My primary research project investigates the therapeutic potential of insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) for treating and preventing Alzheimer's disease. This work combines experimental studies in animal models with comprehensive literature reviews examining the evidence for IGF2 as a neurotrophic therapeutic agent.</p>

            <p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>IGF2 shows promise as both a therapeutic and preventative treatment for AD</li>
                <li>Unlike current AD drugs, IGF2 has favorable safety and tolerability profiles</li>
                <li>IGF2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and targets multiple pathological mechanisms</li>
                <li>Preclinical evidence supports IGF2's ability to enhance cognition and reduce neurodegeneration</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Related publication:</strong> <a href="posts/igf2-alzheimers.html">Insulin-like growth factor-2 is a promising candidate for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease</a></p>

            <h3 class="nocount">Meta-Analysis of Cognitive Enhancement Interventions</h3>
            <p>I'm conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining the effectiveness of various interventions designed to enhance cognitive function in healthy adults and clinical populations. This work focuses on identifying which interventions have robust evidence and understanding sources of heterogeneity across studies.</p>

            <h3 class="nocount">Research Methodology and Reproducibility</h3>
            <p>I'm involved in several projects aimed at improving research practices in neuroscience and psychology, including developing guidelines for meta-analytic research and investigating sources of bias in the literature.</p>
