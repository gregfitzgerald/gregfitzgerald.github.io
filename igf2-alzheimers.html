            <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

            <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Current AD treatments slow the rate of cognitive decline but fail to halt or reverse disease progression. An alternative approach is preventative treatment that targets pathological mechanisms during the presymptomatic phase. This narrative review discusses the therapeutic potential of the neurotrophic peptide insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) for AD treatment and prevention. IGF2 is a pleiotropic factor that plays a key role in memory formation, neuronal growth, and neuroprotection. In the healthy brain, IGF2 declines with aging and is further reduced in AD patients. Preclinical studies demonstrate that exogenous IGF2 enhances cognition, stimulates neurotrophic processes, and attenuates AD pathophysiology in animal models. The favorable safety profile and tolerability of IGF2, combined with its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, make it an attractive candidate for both therapeutic intervention and preventative treatment in AD.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

            <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for 60-80% of all dementia cases, and is the seventh leading cause of death globally. There are currently 20 million AD patients, most of whom are over the age of 65. As demographics shift toward a more aged population, the global prevalence of AD is expected to reach nearly 50 million by 2050. At present, there are no truly effective treatments for AD. Existing drugs alleviate cognitive symptoms but fail to significantly alter disease progression.</p>

            <p>An attractive alternative to the existing approaches is preventative treatment. While treating those patients who have already manifested AD symptoms is an important objective, it is believed that initiating treatment during the long presymptomatic phase of AD pathogenesis may be a more viable therapeutic strategy. Two of the key challenges to implementing preventative treatment are (1) the relative dearth of empirical research into the pathological mechanisms that occur during the presymptomatic phase, and (2) the identification of patients at risk of AD.</p>

            <p>There are five compounds currently approved to treat AD. These include three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) -- donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine -- which potentiate the action of acetylcholine by inhibiting its enzymatic degradation. Next, there is the partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine, which is thought to attenuate cognitive decline by modulating neural circuit excitability. Finally, aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds beta amyloid (Aβ), leading to clearance of some Aβ from the brain.</p>

            <p>None of the current drugs are effective at halting or reversing cognitive impairment. Instead, these drugs are considered effective based on their ability to slow the rate of cognitive decline. This minimal criterion of effectiveness reflects the widespread assumption that progressive cognitive decline in AD is inevitable, with or without treatment.</p>

            <p>In this narrative review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of the neurotrophic peptide insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) in AD treatment. In the healthy brain, IGF2 plays a key role in memory formation, neuronal growth, and neuroprotection. Since IGF2 declines in the brains of AD patients, recent studies have explored the possibility that supplemental IGF2 could ameliorate AD pathophysiology.</p>

            <h2 id="preventative-treatment">The rationale for preventative treatment</h2>

            <p>The comparatively low effectiveness of current AD drugs in arresting cognitive decline is due not only to the failure to target the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms, but also to the relative lateness of drug delivery in the course of AD progression. Current clinical standards recommend drug prescription at the earliest sign of detectable cognitive impairment. However, in the context of AD pathogenesis, overt cognitive decline is a late event that is preceded by years of neuropathological changes.</p>

            <p>Moreover, there are compelling reasons to suppose that functional recovery is implausible once the disease has progressed to the point of cognitive impairment. First, there are no documented cases of recovery from AD dementia. Second, it is unlikely that a disease that develops over decades could be rectified in the 4-8 years that typically separate initial dementia diagnosis from death. Third, the endogenous mechanisms that could plausibly mediate functional recovery may be among the damaged mechanisms that give rise to cognitive impairment.</p>

            <h3 id="identifying-presymptomatic-patients">Identifying presymptomatic patients for putative preventative treatments</h3>

            <p>At present, there are no validated models capable of predicting whether a cognitively normal person will go on to develop AD. However, many risk factors have been identified, such as advanced age, APOE genotype, family history of AD, female sex, cardiovascular disease, peripheral insulin resistance, and history of traumatic brain injury. This rationale has been used to justify the use of statins and aspirin for preventing cardiovascular disease in patients with significant risk factors and no contraindications.</p>

            <h3 id="current-drugs-preventative">Current drugs are unlikely to be effective preventative treatments</h3>

            <p>It is unlikely that existing AD drugs would be effective as preventative treatments. To our knowledge, there are no studies to have assessed the ability of existing drugs to prevent the progression of normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Based on an analysis of their mechanisms of action, the current AD drugs lack the requisite properties to prevent disease progression.</p>

            <p>For the ChEIs, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase potentiates acetylcholine action at remaining synapses but has not been shown to rectify the underlying degeneration of cholinergic neurons and their synapses. Although NMDA receptor dysfunction is a major pathological feature of AD, it is not clear how memantine would attenuate the various neuropathological mechanisms attributed to the NMDA receptor in AD pathology.</p>

            <h3 id="current-drugs-tolerability">Current AD drugs have poor tolerability</h3>

            <p>Another obstacle to repurposing the current AD drugs as preventative treatments is their low tolerability. The ChEIs and memantine are prone to adverse side effects, with gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and dizziness being especially common; these side effects often prompt patients to discontinue treatment. As a newer drug, the tolerability of aducanumab has not been evaluated as extensively as prior AD drugs. However, aducanumab has a nontrivial risk of brain edema, requiring periodic 'surveillance' MRI scans to detect the neuroimaging biomarkers of this serious adverse event.</p>

            <p>The tolerability of a preventative treatment is likely to be an even more salient consideration for presymptomatic individuals than for AD patients. For a cognitively normal person receiving a preventative treatment, any aversive side effects would likely provoke discontinuation, since their experience of the drug would consist entirely of unpleasant symptoms.</p>

            <h2 id="neurotrophic-decline">Neurotrophic decline is a major feature of AD</h2>

            <p>As neurodegeneration progresses in AD, pathological mechanisms directly interfere with the operation of existing neurons, culminating in widespread neuronal death. In addition to this type of direct neurotoxicity, there is also a decline of neurotrophic processes such as neurogenesis. The loss of neurotrophic signaling is implicated in a vicious cycle that is thought to occur in AD progression, wherein early neuropathological changes suppress neurotrophic signaling, which precipitates further neuropathology by removing a source of neuroprotection.</p>

            <p>This pathological cascade is thought to contribute to the profound neurodegeneration seen in AD, where as much as 60% of hippocampal neurons may be lost in advanced stages. Structural atrophy becomes extensive in AD, even before the onset of dementia. Compared to cognitively unimpaired patients, MCI subjects show ~10% lower hippocampal volume, as well as more rapid atrophy in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.</p>

            <h2 id="neurotrophic-signaling">Neurotrophic signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in AD research</h2>

            <p>As part of the generalized neurotrophic decline in AD, there is a corresponding decline in neurotrophic signaling factors, the biomolecules that mediate growth and reorganization of neurons and synapses. Multiple neurotrophic factors have been implicated in AD pathology, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Exogenous BDNF and NGF have been shown to exert procognitive and anti-neurodegenerative effects in rodent models, but these experiments used direct CNS administration, which is regarded as too invasive for most human therapies.</p>

            <h2 id="igf2-therapeutic">The neurotrophic factor IGF2 is a promising therapeutic agent</h2>

            <p>IGF2 is a neurotrophic factor that is observed to decline in AD patients. In recent years, IGF2 has been identified as a modulator of hippocampal cognition that is dysregulated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. IGF2 may have the requisite features of not only a conventional AD treatment, but also a preventative therapy.</p>

            <p>In rodent models of AD, exogenous IGF2 can in some cases ameliorate cognitive impairments, neuropathological changes, and neurotrophic decline. In addition to its potential effectiveness, it has, according to the current body of research, favorable safety and tolerability. IGF2 does not require an invasive route of administration. Compared to other neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and NGF, IGF2 has greater BBB permeability, which is associated with greater bioavailability to the brain.</p>

            <h2 id="igf2-overview">Overview of IGF2</h2>

            <p>IGF2 is a pleiotropic peptide that belongs to a network of interrelated signaling factors known as the insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) axis. In placental mammals, this axis includes three major ligands: insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and IGF2. These ligands bind with varying affinity to three main receptors: insulin receptor (IR), IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), and IGF2 receptor (IGF2R).</p>

            <p>The Igf2 gene has four known gene products: pro-IGF2 (1-156), two variants of big-IGF2 (1-87 and 1-104), and fully-cleaved ('mature') IGF2 (1-67). In humans, the predominant Igf2 product in both circulation and the CNS is fully-cleaved IGF2. This pattern is notably different in laboratory rodents, which show CNS expression of fully-cleaved IGF2 yet have virtually no fully-cleaved IGF2 in the blood.</p>

            <p>IGF2 binds all three receptors in the IIS axis. In the CNS, the neurotrophic effects of IGF2 have been attributed to all three IIS receptors. A major physiological function of IGF2 is mitogenic signaling via IGF1R, which promotes growth, differentiation, and survival in multiple tissues.</p>

            <h2 id="igf2-distribution">IGF2 distribution in the CNS in health and AD</h2>

            <p>IGF2 is expressed throughout the CNS, acting as a neurotrophic signaling factor in both the parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Among the major cell types in the brain parenchyma, Igf2 expression is highest in neurons, though microglia also secrete IGF2 in some circumstances. IGF2 and its three receptor targets are highly expressed in the hippocampus, a major site of pathological changes in AD.</p>

            <p>Learning drives synthesis of hippocampal IGF2, promoting memory formation. In AD, there is dramatic decline in hippocampal IGF2 expression in both human AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD. The IGF2 contained in CSF also exerts neurotrophic effects. The major sources of IGF2 in CSF are the choroid plexus and leptomeninges, which show the highest Igf2 expression in the entire CNS.</p>

            <h2 id="circulating-igf2">The role of circulating IGF2 in neurocognitive function</h2>

            <p>The blood is another potential source of IGF2 for the CNS. Exogenous IGF2 enters both the parenchyma and CSF. However, it is unclear whether free IGFs are physiologically relevant, given that only ~0.13% of IGF2 in circulation is present as free IGF2. Additionally, at 7.5 kDa, free IGF2 is too large to diffuse across the BBB and would therefore require a facilitated transport mechanism.</p>

            <p>The contribution of circulating IGF2 to neural function, including cognition, is poorly understood. There is substantial variation in circulating IGF2 among healthy adults (300-1100 ng/mL), but this natural variation does not appear to correlate with AD status or degree of cognitive impairment.</p>

            <h2 id="cognitive-impairments">IGF2 rescues cognitive impairments in mouse models of AD</h2>

            <p>As previously discussed, cognitive deterioration is generally regarded as the most devastating aspect of AD. Therefore, it is crucial that a candidate AD treatment suppresses AD-associated cognitive decline. IGF2 has been shown to improve hippocampal memory function in transgenic mouse models of AD. Consistent with its role as a modulator of hippocampal cognition, exogenous IGF2 has been reported to enhance memory formation and to ameliorate age-related cognitive decline.</p>

            <p>The procognitive effects of hippocampal IGF2 have been attributed to both IGF2R and IGF1R. It is important to note that the procognitive effects of IGF2 cannot be completely dissociated from its broader neurotrophic role. For example, when intrahippocampal IGF2 enhances the extinction of a contextual fear memory it does so by promoting the maturation of 17-19 day-old neurons undergoing neurogenesis.</p>

            <h2 id="cholinergic-dysfunction">IGF2 alleviates cholinergic dysfunction</h2>

            <p>Acetylcholine modulates hippocampal cognition, and the decline in acetylcholine neurotransmission is an early pathological event in AD. During a spatial memory task, extracellular acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus nearly double; moreover, the relative increase in acetylcholine correlates with improved task performance.</p>

            <p>The underlying causes of reduced acetylcholine neurotransmission in AD are (1) degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, and (2) reduced abundance and activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine in the presynaptic terminal. While ChEIs potentiate the action of acetylcholine at remaining synapses, this mechanism fails to address either of these underlying causes. By contrast, IGF2 is reported to preserve cholinergic neurons and potentiate ChAT activity.</p>

            <p>IGF2 acutely enhances acetylcholine neurotransmission, albeit by a different mechanism than that of the ChEI drugs. In ex vivo rat brain slices, IGF2 administration evokes acetylcholine release in the hippocampus, striatum, and frontal cortex. This release is mediated by the IGF2R, which colocalizes with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vAchT) in the hippocampus and basal forebrain.</p>

            <h2 id="amyloid-pathology">IGF2 ameliorates amyloid pathology</h2>

            <p>The accumulation of Aβ in the parenchyma is a pathological hallmark of AD, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and elevated levels of soluble Aβ. There is evidence to suggest that IGF2 may protect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. In the Tg2576 mouse strain, neuroprotection against elevated Aβ secretion was shown to be mediated by endogenous IGF2 secretion via an IGF1R-dependent mechanism.</p>

            <p>IGF2 administration has been shown to reduce amyloid pathology in mouse models of AD, albeit with routes of administration that would be unsuitable for humans. In APP/PS1 mice, 7 days of chronic ICV IGF2 administration reduced amyloid plaques in the hippocampus. In the Tg2576 strain, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of IGF2 in the hippocampus reduced soluble Aβ levels in the prefrontal and parietotemporal cortices.</p>

            <p>Synaptic degeneration is a major pathological process in AD, with reduced synaptic density in the hippocampus correlating with degree of cognitive impairment. The density of neurons and synapses in key brain areas has been suggested to be the physiological correlate of cognitive reserve, the ability of some patients to resist cognitive decline despite the presence of overt neuropathology.</p>

            <p>Another avenue by which IGF2 may augment synapses in the hippocampus is by facilitating synaptogenesis. Acting as a neuropeptide, presynaptic IGF2 is necessary for the stabilization of hippocampal synapses formed following synaptic activity. IGF2 is a downstream effector of the IKK/NF-κB pathway, which regulates synapse formation and spine maturation in the hippocampus.</p>
