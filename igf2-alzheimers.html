        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Current AD treatments slow the rate of cognitive decline but do not restore lost function. One reason for the low efficacy of current treatments is that they fail to target neurotrophic processes, which are thought to be essential for functional recovery. Bolstering neurotrophic processes may also be a viable strategy for preventative treatment, since structural losses are thought to underlie cognitive decline in AD. Due to the challenge of identifying presymptomatic patients who might benefit from preventative treatment, any such treatment must meet a high standard of safety and tolerability. The neurotrophic peptide insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) is a promising candidate for both treating and preventing AD-induced cognitive decline.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for 60-80% of all dementia cases, and is the seventh leading cause of death globally. There are currently 20 million AD patients, most of whom are over the age of 65. As demographics shift toward a more aged population, the global prevalence of AD is expected to reach nearly 50 million by 2050.</p>

        <p>At present, there are no truly effective treatments for AD. Existing drugs alleviate cognitive symptoms but fail to significantly alter disease progression. The underwhelming performance of the most recent FDA-approved AD drug, aducanumab, has highlighted the need for fresh approaches.</p>

        <p>In this narrative review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of the neurotrophic peptide insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) in AD treatment. In the healthy brain, IGF2 plays a key role in memory formation, neuronal growth, and neuroprotection. Since IGF2 declines in the brains of AD patients, recent studies have explored the possibility that supplemental IGF2 could ameliorate AD pathophysiology.</p>

        <h2>The Rationale for Preventative Treatment</h2>
        <p>The comparatively low effectiveness of current AD drugs in arresting cognitive decline is due not only to the failure to target the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms, but also to the relative lateness of drug delivery in the course of AD progression. Current clinical standards recommend drug prescription at the earliest sign of detectable cognitive impairment. However, in the context of AD pathogenesis, overt cognitive decline is a late event that is preceded by years of neuropathological changes.</p>

        <h2>IGF2 as a Therapeutic Target</h2>
        <p>IGF2 is a neurotrophic factor that is observed to decline in AD patients. In recent years, IGF2 has been identified as a modulator of hippocampal cognition that is dysregulated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. IGF2 may have the requisite features of not only a conventional AD treatment, but also a preventative therapy.</p>

        <p>In rodent models of AD, exogenous IGF2 can in some cases ameliorate cognitive impairments, neuropathological changes, and neurotrophic decline. In addition to its potential effectiveness, it has, according to the current body of research, favorable safety and tolerability.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>IGF2 shows promise as both a therapeutic and preventative treatment for AD</li>
            <li>Unlike current AD drugs, IGF2 has favorable safety and tolerability profiles</li>
            <li>IGF2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and targets multiple pathological mechanisms</li>
            <li>Preclinical evidence supports IGF2's ability to enhance cognition and reduce neurodegeneration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The preclinical data on IGF2 with regard to procognitive and anti-neurodegenerative effects, favorable safety, and good tolerability suggest that IGF2 may be a promising candidate for the treatment and prevention of AD. Future research should focus on translating these promising preclinical findings into clinical trials.</p>
