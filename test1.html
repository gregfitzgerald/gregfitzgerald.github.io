        <h1>Thoughts on Meta-Analysis Methodology</h1>
        
        <p><em>Created: January 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>Meta-analysis is often considered the gold standard of evidence synthesis, but the methodology itself deserves critical examination. This post explores some current challenges and potential improvements in how we conduct meta-analyses.</p>
        
        <h2>The Problem with Fixed Effects Models</h2>
        
        <p>Many researchers default to fixed effects models without considering whether their assumptions hold. The assumption that all studies are estimating the same underlying effect size is rarely justified in practice.</p>

        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">This is particularly problematic in neuroscience, where study populations, methods, and contexts vary significantly.</span>
        
        <p>Random effects models, while more complex, often provide a more realistic framework for understanding heterogeneity between studies.</p>
        
        <h2>Publication Bias Detection</h2>
        
        <p>Traditional funnel plots and Egger's test have limited sensitivity for detecting publication bias. Newer methods like:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>PET-PEESE regression</li>
            <li>Selection models</li>
            <li>P-curve analysis</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>offer more robust approaches to understanding selective reporting.</p>
        
        <h2>The Search Strategy Problem</h2>
        
        <p>Systematic searches often miss important studies due to overly restrictive search terms or database limitations. The rise of preprint servers and grey literature complicates traditional search strategies.</p>
        
        <p>Moving forward, meta-analysts need to embrace:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More inclusive search strategies</li>
            <li>Better collaboration with librarians</li>
            <li>Transparent reporting of search limitations</li>
        </ul>
