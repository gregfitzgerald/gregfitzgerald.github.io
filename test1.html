            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> in this post I explain why you should start a research blog (to help others and to help yourself), what to write about, and how to start it. I hope to persuade you that you should start a blog even if you feel that you have nothing to say and even if almost nobody will read it.</p>

            <p>I looked over all of my writing and determined that it all originated from one of the following:</p>

            <p>Most likely you do at least some of the things I described above. And that means you probably have something to write about.</p>

            <h2 id="but-nobody-will-read-my-blog">"But nobody will read my blog"</h2>

            <p>It doesn't matter! Your blog may have the median of 0 visitors per day (as my blog had for the first two years). Your blog may be ungoogleable. Your blog may have no subscribers. But if you're not embarrassed to tell people "oh, btw I wrote about this methodology issue on my blog", the purpose of the blog is fulfilled, since this is the best indicator of your writing actually being helpful.</p>

            <p>But there are a few other reasons to write, the most important of which is that…</p>

            <h2 id="writing-helps-you-think-better">Writing helps you think better</h2>

            <p>In a parallel universe I became a research supervisor. In this universe I sometimes offer my graduate student friends to listen to their research problems like a supervisor would and to maybe give them a few comments. In the last couple of months I did this for two friends and both of them told me almost the same exact thing: <strong>while preparing for the conversation with me, they ended up writing a lot of their research thoughts and concerns down in a readable, essay-like form for the first time and this very act helped them to understand what is going on much better and to fix a lot of problems even prior to our conversation.</strong></p>

            <p>This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: <strong>writing not only helps you to understand what's going on in your research and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new research directions and come up with solutions to your methodological problems.</strong><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="sidenote">This is particularly important in meta-analysis where the complexity of decisions can be overwhelming without clear documentation.</span></p>

            <p>But this only applies to "essay-like" writing where you pretend to write for someone else and think about narrative and exposition and not just write down a few keyword-bullets for yourself. This is actually why you should not only write blog posts but also have a private research journal with coherent text about what's going on in your projects and in your methodological thinking.</p>

            <p>The analogy is as follows: you probably had experience learning statistics or research methods where <strong>you listen to the lecturer and you understand everything perfectly and then you try to actually conduct the analysis and you realize that you have no idea how to do it. This is the way research and everything else in the world works.</strong> You can read all the methodology books in the world. You can read all the blog posts in the world. It's not enough. Good research thinking doesn't happen by passive osmosis of other people's good thinking. You have to actually write about methods and research to debug yourself and your ideas.</p>

            <h2 id="but-i-dont-have-anything-original">"But I don't have anything original to say and I would be just repeating things said elsewhere!"</h2>

            <p>Consider a university professor teaching a research methods course. Does she say anything original? Do you think she should cancel her course because somebody else discovered the statistical methods she wants to teach? Or does she have to cancel her course simply because there is a similar course at some other university?</p>

            <p>Or consider yourself. Do you avoid having conversations with your research colleagues when you think you have nothing original to say? Do you share methodological insights with them? Do you give advice about analysis approaches?</p>

            <p>As a concrete example, consider my most popular post ever: <a href="#">What Should You Do with Your Research Career?</a>. Let's go through it section by section:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>a bunch of links I collected about research careers</li>
                <li>semi-trivial advice that basically says you should start working on research projects and then share them with other people</li>
                <li>a few notes on academic networking, which are basically a rephrase of stuff I read on academic Twitter + two examples of my emails</li>
                <li>a bunch more links I collected about funding opportunities</li>
                <li>a bunch more links with quotes about research productivity</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Does this post contain a single original idea? I don't think it does. Is it useful? Well, yeah, it is<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="sidenote">The post has been shared over 500 times and led to collaborations and opportunities for many readers.</span>. But this brings me to a more general idea…</p>

            <h2 id="why-unoriginal-writing-is-useful">Why unoriginal writing is useful</h2>

            <p>Because it helps in the process of discovery and in the process of supporting underappreciated methodological insights.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Many important statistical methods were basically ignored for years after their initial publication. The people who decided to write about these "unoriginal" methods later were necessary for the appreciation and spread of these techniques.</li>
                <li>it might be the case that the person reading my notes about power analysis previously saw <em>n</em> mentions of the thought "calculating power is important" and my post might be the final <i>(n+1)</i>st encounter of this idea that finally convinces them that it's important and finally makes them actually do proper power calculations</li>
                <li>this is also largely the value of methodology workshops and conferences. There's not that many new ideas in every presentation but if you attend regularly, there's a good chance some of the most important lessons will finally get stuck in your head and will motivate you to improve your research practices</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="how-to-start-a-blog">How to start a blog</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>go over your emails and research notes and see if some of the conversations there fit the themes I wrote about in the first section of this post</li>
                <li>try noticing the things I wrote about in the first section (e.g. do you tend to give the same methodological advice to colleagues) for a while and write down some notes in a text file</li>
                <li>clear out an entire day to write (yes, this is possible however busy you feel you are with research. Let it be some next Saturday or Sunday)</li>
                <li>write during that special day</li>
                <li>launch a blog on GitHub Pages / WordPress / whatever. It doesn't matter in the beginning and you can always change the platform later. At first just make sure to actually publish something.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="writing-is-really-hard">"Writing is really hard"</h2>

            <p>Yes. It will get slightly easier, though (I've been writing about research for the last few years and substantial posts still require significant effort). Here are a few tricks to make it easier:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>pretend that you have a conversation with a colleague and dictate to your phone or write into a document as if you're explaining the concept to them, then edit the resulting text
                    <ul>
                        <li>or do actually have a conversation with a colleague explaining your methodological insight, while recording it. Then transcribe and edit it into a post</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>or pretend you're writing an email to a graduate student asking for advice (by opening email and literally writing the letter). Then edit this email into a post</li>
                <li>if you're writing a post and you don't like it, don't be scared to just start writing it from the beginning again. I rewrite most of my posts from the ground up several times.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key insight: <strong>the explicit point of a first draft is to get you to a second draft.</strong> I rewrote this post 3 times and rewrite most posts at least 1-2 times before publishing.</p>

            <h2 id="a-few-more-reasons">A few more reasons to write</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>even though most research blogs will remain deeply unpopular, some people will achieve significant influence in their field and will change how research is conducted. Since in advance you don't know what level of impact you'll achieve, it's worth trying</li>
                <li>having a blog may be useful as a way to demonstrate that you think clearly about methodology when you apply for positions or funding</li>
                <li>writing regularly will make you a better grant writer, paper writer, and communicator in general</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Would you save the post that you wrote to your reference manager if you randomly stumbled on it while doing a literature search?</strong> If you want your writing to stay with people, you need to first make sure that it would have stayed with you!</p>
